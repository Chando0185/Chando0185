**`Software Enginner`**

"Hello, my name is Mishu, and I am a machine learning engineer with 2 years of hands-on experience. I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven solutions to tackle real-world problems. Over the past couple of years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of machine learning projects that have honed my technical skills and deepened my understanding of the field. My journey started with a solid foundation in both Python programming and fundamental machine learning concepts, which I've since applied to projects ranging from predictive modeling to computer vision.. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel "[Knowledge Doctor][youtube]" to more than 17k subscribers.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª KNOWLEDGE DOCTOR Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My coding journey has been an exciting blend of learning, experimenting, and applying my skills to real-world problems.

I began by building a strong foundation in Python, as it's an essential tool in the machine learning world. I started with basic syntax, data structures, and gradually moved on to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming. As I honed my Python skills, I was able to tackle coding challenges and gradually transitioned to working on machine learning projects.

Early in my journey, I focused on learning the core machine learning concepts, including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, and clustering. This knowledge allowed me to work on my first few projects, where I applied algorithms like linear regression and decision trees to solve problems such as predicting sales trends and customer segmentation.

As I delved deeper into the field, I ventured into more complex areas like deep learning. I became proficient with libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, which opened up opportunities to work on projects involving image classification and natural language processing tasks. One memorable project involved training a convolutional neural network to identify objects in images, which required a solid understanding of not only the algorithms but also data preprocessing and model optimization techniques.

Throughout my journey, I learned the importance of clean, maintainable, and efficient code. I embraced version control systems like Git, which allowed me to collaborate effectively with team members and track changes in my codebase. Moreover, I became passionate about writing modular and well-documented code, ensuring that my projects were not only functional but also understandable to colleagues and collaborators.

One key aspect of my coding journey has been continuous learning. I regularly engage with online courses, research papers, and technical blogs to stay updated on the latest advancements in the field. This thirst for knowledge has led me to experiment with cutting-edge techniques like transfer learning and generative adversarial networks.

In summary, my coding journey as a Python machine learning engineer has been a rewarding progression from mastering Python's fundamentals to confidently implementing complex machine learning algorithms. It's a journey of curiosity, determination, and constant improvement, and I'm excited to bring this experience to the challenges and opportunities ahead."
